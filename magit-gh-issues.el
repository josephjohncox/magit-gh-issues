;;; Commentary:

;; This mode is still a work-in-progress, use at your own risk.

;; This is a Magit extension for manipulating GitHub issues

;; No configuration is needed in the repository of any of your remotes contain a
;; URL to Github's remote repository. If for some reason you don't have any
;; Github remotes in your config, you can specify username and repository
;; explicitly:

;; $ git config magit.gh-issues-repo <user>/<repo> # your github repository

;; Add these lines to your init.el:

;; (require 'magit-gh-issues.el)
;; (add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'turn-on-magit-gh-issues)

;; There are currently 2 bindings for issues:
;; # g i  --- refreshes the list of issues
;; # g b  --- browse the issue using 'browse-url
